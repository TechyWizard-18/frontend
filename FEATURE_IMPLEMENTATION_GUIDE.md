## üìû SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues:

**1. Excel Import Not Working:**
- Ensure xlsx package is installed: `npm install xlsx`
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Excel file format matches template

**2. Remarks Not Saving:**
- Check backend logs for PATCH request errors
- Verify MongoDB connection
- Ensure PPO model has `pendingRemark` field

**3. Red Highlight Not Showing:**
- Check if PO is actually 5+ days old
- Verify PO status is "Pending"
- Clear browser cache and reload

---

## üé® UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS

1. **Better Readability:** List view provides more horizontal space for customer info
2. **Visual Alerts:** Red highlighting immediately draws attention to overdue POs
3. **Contextual Actions:** Remarks feature only available for pending POs (cleaner UI)
4. **Batch Operations:** Excel import saves time for bulk data entry
5. **User Feedback:** Toast notifications and import results provide clear feedback

---

## üìä EXCEL IMPORT BUSINESS LOGIC

1. **Customer Creation:**
   - Check if customer exists by phone number
   - Create new customer if doesn't exist
   - Skip creation if customer exists (prevent duplicates)

2. **PO Creation:**
   - Only create PO if poValue and poType are provided
   - Link PO to customer (new or existing)
   - Set default status to "Pending" if not specified

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Collect all failed entries
   - Continue processing remaining rows
   - Provide detailed error report

---

## üîê SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

1. **File Upload:** Only .xlsx and .xls files accepted
2. **Data Validation:** Phone numbers validated (10-15 digits)
3. **SQL Injection:** Protected by mongoose (parameterized queries)
4. **Error Messages:** Sanitized to prevent information leakage

---

2. Add progress bar for large imports
